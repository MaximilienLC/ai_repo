    """Neuroevolution ``subtask`` config.

    Args:
        agents_per_task: Number of agents per task (``num_tasks`` =
            ``num_nodes`` x ``tasks_per_node``).
        total_num_gens: Number of generations to run the experiment for
            (including the previous number of generations).
        save_interval: Number of generations between each save point.
            `0` means no save point except for the last generation.
        save_first_gen: Whether to save the state of the experiment
            after the first generation (usually for plotting purposes).
        pop_merge: Whether to merge both generator and discriminator
            populations into a single population. This means that each
            agent will be evaluated on both its generative and
            discriminative abilities.
        env_transfer: Whether an agent's environment state
            (position, velocity, ...) is transferred to its children
            if it passes through the selection process.
        fit_transfer: Whether an agent's fitness is transferred to
            its children if it passes through the selection process.
        mem_transfer: Whether an agent's memory (hidden state) is
            transferred to its children if it passes through the
            selection process.
        eval_num_steps: Number of environment steps to run each agent
            for during evaluation. ``0`` means that the agent will run
            until the environment terminates (``eval_num_steps = 0`` is
            not supported for ``env_transfer = True``).
        logging: Whether to log the experiment to Weights & Biases.
