==================

.. note ::

    Suggestion: Open a tmux session to run the following commands.

Run a python script
-------------------

.. note::

    The following command was designed for the BÃ©luga cluster. It will most
    likely need refining on other clusters.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Example of a simple MNIST training run
    module load apptainer && cd ${AI_REPO_PATH} && export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${AI_REPO_PATH} && \
        export APPTAINERENV_APPEND_PATH=/opt/software/slurm/bin:/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/Core/apptainer/1.1.8/bin && \
        apptainer exec --no-home -B /etc/passwd -B /etc/slurm/ -B /opt/software/slurm -B /usr/lib64/libmunge.so.2 \
