1. Weights & biases
-------------------

Weights & Biases is a tool to log experiments. In order to make use of it, you
will need to create an account on their `website <https://www.wandb.com/>`_ and
generate an API key. Once you have done so, create a file called
``WANDB_KEY.txt`` at the root of the repository and paste your API key in it.

You can now log experiments to your personal account. You can also log
experiments to an academic team account for free.
